exe2icns

This program reads a Windows Portable Executable (.exe) file and generates an 
Apple .icns file from its main icon.


Requirements

- A C compiler.
  You may have to edit some code to support old compilers.

- One of zlib, ImageIO (Mac OS X), QuickTime for PNG encoding/decoding.

- 'palette' tool requires Mac OS X and 32-bit build environment (or classic 
  Mac OS).
  This is a QuickDraw system palette dumper, and not needed by exe2icns.


How to build...

1. Edit Makefile.
 You can choose PNG encoder/decoder from several png_*.o. 
 Read Makefile for details.
 You may also want to edit CFLAGS, etc. here.

2. Run make.


Notes

The icons it can process are 16x16 (is32), 32x32 (il32), 48x48 (ih32), 128x128 
(it32), 256x256 (ic07). Icons of other sizes are skipped.
All icons are encoded into 32-bit format with 8-bit mask, even when the original
icon has less colours. If the .exe has multiple icons with the same size, the
one with the largest colour depth is used.
